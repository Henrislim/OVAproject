Besides, the load is a optical variable \r\nattenuator (OVA-650), whose attenuation is propotional to the output of a potentialmeter or voltage divider. The OVA\r\nis driven by the PWMs generated by the arduino, and the value of potentialmeter' voltage is read by ADS1105, a 12-bit\r\nADC component. The arduino will request to obtain the voltage from ADS1105 and receive the result through I2C. Moreover,\r\nCool Term on PC is used to communicate with the arduino, and in other words, the user can send commands to the arduino\r\nthrough this interface.\r\n\r\nThe project is in progress, and we are very happy to share our codes with you and willing to hear any comments ,suggestions\r\nand advice from you.\r\n\r\nBy the way, thanks the \"Information Technology\" in 21st century that provide me with abundant resources to refer to.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
