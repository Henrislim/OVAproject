      <p>Key words: Optics, Arduino Pro Mini, ADS1105,ADC,PWM,CoolTerm,UART...</p>

<p>This is a project in which an optical variable attenuator is driven and controlled by arduino pro mini</p>

<p>The microcontroller is ATmega328p, which is embedded on the arduino pro mini. Besides, the load is an optical variable attenuator (OVA-650), whose attenuation is propotional to the output of a potentialmeter or voltage divider. The OVA is driven by the PWMs generated by the arduino, and the value of potentialmeter' voltage is read by ADS1105, a 12-bit ADC component. The arduino will request to obtain the voltage from ADS1105 and receive the result through I2C. Moreover, Cool Term on PC is used to communicate with the arduino, and in other words, the user can send commands to the arduino through this interface.</p>

<p>The project is in progress, and I am very happy to share the codes with you and willing to hear any comments ,suggestions and advice from you.</p>

<p>By the way, thanks the "Information Technology" in 21st century that provides me with abundant resources to refer to.</p>
